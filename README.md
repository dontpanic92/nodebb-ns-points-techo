## Ranking Calculation

Settings could vary from one calculator to another. Calculator must return object with properties listed below:

- rank [Number] - user's rank, level
- rankProgress [Number] - amount of points on current level
- rankTotal [Number] - amount of points needed to level-up
- total [Number] - raw amount of points

Example: [Default Function](https://github.com/NicolasSiver/nodebb-plugin-ns-points/blob/f34a4cf6c69b4c8b1abbf88efc3a0f1d8ad6fcf2/public/js/ranking.js#L9-L27)

## Themes

Plugin populates both: `Profile` and `Topic` views. Search for `points` property in corresponding entities.

### Profile View

If you want points in Profile, do very basic changes to your theme:

> Example: Vanilla Theme, `/account/profile.tpl`, edit template in package directory - `node_modules`

```html
<div class="text-center account-stats">

    <div class="inline-block text-center">
        <span class="human-readable-number" title="{reputation}">{reputation}</span>
        <span class="account-bio-label">[[global:reputation]]</span>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-block text-center">
        <span class="human-readable-number" title="{postcount}">{postcount}</span>
        <span class="account-bio-label">[[global:posts]]</span>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-block text-center">
        <span class="human-readable-number" title="{profileviews}">{profileviews}</span>
        <span class="account-bio-label">[[user:profile_views]]</span>
    </div>

    <!-- IF points -->
    <div class="inline-block text-center">
        <span class="human-readable-number" title="{points}">{points}</span>
        <span class="account-bio-label">Points</span>
    </div>
    <!-- ENDIF points -->
    
</div>
```

### Topic View

Every post will have additional field: `points`.
If you want utilize points calculation feature in topic view, you should use theme that supports such type of integration.
